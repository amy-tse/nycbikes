In late 2020, de Blasio unveiled the largest one-year bike and bus lane expansion in NYC history. Since then, he has created miles of bike lanes, and the Department of Transportation has recently released its 5-year plan in which they hope to achieve 250 miles of protected bike lanes by 2026. Bike ridership has been a hot topic in the city, and bike share systems like CitiBike have been expanding rapidly over the past few years. Citibike is a privately owned public bicylcle sharing system that allows users to rent a bike that is parked at multiple stations throughout the city, and drop it off at another station when finished. This project explores bike trends in NYC to observe the impact on bike ridership, based on the change in bike riders using bike count data and bike-share (citiBike) usage.


Python 3.8, Pandas, and Plotly is used for this project.
