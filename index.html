              <p>
                In late 2020, de Blasio unveiled the largest one-year bike and
                bus lane expansion in NYC history. Since then, he has created
                miles of bike lanes, and the Department of Transportation has
                recently released its 5-year plan in which they hope to achieve
                250 miles of protected bike lanes by 2026. Bike ridership has
                been a hot topic in the city, and bike share systems like
                CitiBike have been expanding rapidly over the past few years.
                Citibike is a privately owned public bicylcle sharing system
                that allows users to rent a bike that is parked at multiple
                stations throughout the city, and drop it off at another station
                when finished. I want to analyze the bike trends in NYC to see
                if this policy has made an impact on bike ridership, based on
                the change in bike riders using bike count data and bike-share
                (citiBike) usage. My objective is to find out whether or not we
                should continue pushing for bike expansion policies in the city,
                or if bike ridership has already reached its potential as a mode
                of transportation in NYC.
              </p>
              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                Although the push to increase bikers in the efforts of creating
                a green-er NYC, I was skeptical of the results of the bike lane
                expansion. Personally, I have noticed an increase in vehicular
                traffic and MTA ridership rather than see an increase in bikers.
                My hypothesis was that bike ridership is not a popular form of
                transportation in the city, and that ridership has been stagnant
                since the bike lane expansions. To discover whether or not my
                theory was correct, I used publicly available data to find the
                counts of bike riders over the last few years. I used Python
                3.8, Pandas, and Plotly.

                NYC Open Data releases bicycle counts conducted around NYC at
                key locations. Each line contains the bike counts in 15 minute
                increments, as well as the location. Bicycle counting technology
                is used, and the data is limited to select locations.
                Thus, this data has more limitations than the Citibike data
                .

                There were over 100 CitiBike csv files to scrape through, as
                they released each csv monthly for the years 2013-2021. I had to
                write a program to parse through all 108 files, to extract the
                monthly count for each one. I used Pandas to clean the files,
                and processed them using string and pandas techniques. I then
                calculated the mean and average using the .mean and .sum
                functions. A snippet of the citibike_counts.csv file I created:

                <br />Conclusion: Definitely an upwards trend, a small dip
                during covid, but since bike expansions started happening in
                early 2021, citiBike usage has increased. <br /><br /><br />
                Using the citibike_counts.csv file I created above, I got the
                percentage of each month’s average citibike riders, to find what
                percentage of citibike rides are taken each month on average.
                The goal was to see which months have the most citiBike
                bicyclists. I used pandas for this once again to clean and
                scrape the data. A snippet of the
                citibike_monthly_percentages.csv file I created:<br /><br />
                <img
                  src="https://cdn.glitch.me/fef072bb-300a-4a5b-92b9-5a8caa28c36c%2Fbf439dac-a55a-4de6-a9b2-cbbf0d71d915.image.png?v=1639122631997"

                <br />
                Conclusion: Winter months have much lower citiBike utilization. June to October have the highest percentages, and they make up more than half of the yearly average. The winter months typically have half the amount of ridership as the warmer months. February sees the least CitiBike riders.

              <h3>NYC OpenData Bicycle Count</h3>
              <p style="text-align:left;">
                The NYC OpenData Bicycle Counts file contains over 4 million
                rows, each one containing bicycle counts in 15 minute
                increments, from 2013 to 2021. I first dropped the columns that
                I didn’t need, and changed the date to date time objects. From
                there, I then grouped together the rows with the same month and
                years. I manipulated the data to create a new data frame that
                contained the count for each month and year. I then calculated
                the mean and average. A snippet of the nyc_counts.csv file I
                created:<br /><br />

                ><br />
                Conclusion: OpenData NYC data shows that bike ridership has practically stayed the same even after bike lane expansions. However it is to be noted that the 
                bicycle count does not capture every bicycle ride in NYC, and only some locations have bicycle counting technology installed. Furthermore, with the creation of new bike lanes, perhaps bicyclists are preferring to ride those new paths that may not have counters installed. Thus, the data is more limited than CitiBike’s, and should not be weighed as heavily.

                <br />Conclusion: Similar findings to the citiBike monthly
                percentage above. Winter months see far fewer bicylcists.
              </p>

              <h2>
                Overall Conclusion and Analysis
              </h2>
              My hypothesis was incorrect; the bike lane expansion policy as
              well as citiBike’s increasing presence in NYC have undeniably
              increased the amount of bikers in NYC over the years. There is a
              great upwards trends over the years, showing that biking is in
              fact not out of style, and will likely continue to prosper.
              However, we see that on average, the winter months see much less
              bicycle utilization. I propose that it may be more efficient would
              be to have more bike lanes in the summer and spring months, and
              reduce the number of lanes in the fall and spring. This would be
              much more efficient and cause less traffic in NYC.
